                Important File Import Tip:
                When receiving .json or .csv files through messaging apps (Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp), you MUST save them to the native Files app first, then share to Ship Pilot Checklists. This extra step is required due to iOS security. See Import & Export help section for details.

                1. File Import Tip:
                When colleagues share .json or .csv files via messaging apps:
                • Save the file to your Files app first
                • Then share it to Ship Pilot Checklists
                • Direct imports from messaging apps often fail
                • This works 100% of the time
                
                2. ⭐ Use Favorites:
                • Star your most-used checklists for instant access
                • Critical during emergencies when seconds count
                • Access all favorites from the main menu
                
                3. 📸 Document Everything:
                • Take photos during incidents for evidence
                • Add notes to specific checklist items
                • Generate PDFs before clearing checklists
                
                4. 🚨 Set Up Emergency Contacts First:
                • Add Coast Guard, dispatch, and company contacts
                • Test the Emergency SMS feature during drills
                • Keep VHF channels updated
                
                5. 🌙 Use Night Mode on the Bridge:
                • Tap sun/moon icon to switch themes
                • Green text preserves night vision
                • Reduces screen glare in dark conditions
                
                💡 Pro Tip: Practice using the app during drills so you're familiar with all features before you need them in a real emergency.

                CSV Alternative with Categories:
                Consider using CSV import instead if you need:

                • Bulk addition of maritime-specific fields
                • Import from existing spreadsheets or databases
                • Team-wide standardized contact lists
                
                The CSV import method allows you to specify categories for each contact, eliminating the manual drag-and-drop organization step.
                
                This is the fastest way to get your contact database established when first setting up the app.

                ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Direct Import from Messaging Apps
                
                When receiving .json or .csv files through messaging apps (Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp, Teams, etc.), iOS security restrictions often prevent direct importing. Follow these steps for reliable imports:
                
                ✅ Recommended Import Method:
                1. In your messaging app, tap and hold the file
                2. Choose "Save to Files"
                3. Select a location (iCloud Drive or On My iPhone)
                4. Open the Files app
                5. Find your saved file
                6. Tap the file to preview it
                7. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
                8. Select "Ship Pilot Checklists" from the share sheet
                
                Why This Extra Step?
                • Messaging apps store files in protected containers
                • iOS security prevents direct access between apps
                • The Files app provides a neutral, accessible location
                • This method works 100% of the time

                • ✅ Email attachments - Usually work directly
                • ✅ AirDrop - Works directly between iOS devices
                • ✅ Cloud storage links - Download to Files first
                • ❌ Direct from messaging apps - Often fails
                
                Supported File Types:
                • .json - For contacts and checklists (universal format)
                • .csv - For contacts and checklists (spreadsheet format)
                • .shipchecklist - For custom checklists only
                
                Troubleshooting:
                If you see "Could not access the file" error:
                • You tried to import directly from a messaging app
                • Save to Files app first, then try again
                • Make sure the file isn't corrupted or empty
                
                💡 Pro Tip:
                Create a folder in Files app called "Ship Pilot Imports" to keep all your import files organized in one place.

                Exporting Contacts (JSON):
                1. Go to Contacts
                2. Tap "Export Contacts" at bottom
                3. Select categories to include:

                Importing JSON Contacts:
                • Save file to Files app first (if from messaging apps)
                • Share to Ship Pilot Checklists from Files app

                Category Column Features:
                • Include a "Category" column to auto-organize contacts during import
                • Contacts with matching category names go into existing categories
                • New categories are automatically created for unmatched names
                • If no category specified, contacts go to timestamped "Imported CSV" category
                • Case-insensitive matching (e.g., "emergency" matches "Emergency")
                
                Column Header Recognition:
                The app recognizes many variations of column names:
                • "Phone Number", "Mobile", "Cell", "Telephone" all work for phone
                • "Contact Name", "Full Name", "Person" all work for names
                • "Job Title", "Position", "Rank" all work for roles
                • "Category", "Group", "Type", "Department" all work for categories

                Import Process:
                1. Create spreadsheet with contact information
                2. Include a "Category" column to organize contacts automatically
                3. Save as standard CSV (not UTF-8 CSV)
                4. If receiving via messaging app, save to Files app first
                5. Share CSV file to Ship Pilot Checklists from Files app
                6. Contacts imported into their specified categories
                7. New categories created as needed

                Smart Name Generation:
                • If name is empty but organization and role exist, generates name automatically
                • Example: "Miller Marine Dispatcher" from org + role
                • Falls back to "Contact [phone]" if no other info available

                Platform Compatibility Matrix:
                
                JSON Files Work With:
                ✅ All email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Yahoo)

                Best Practices Summary:
                1. ALWAYS use Files app method for messaging app imports
                2. Use JSON for contact sharing (maximum compatibility)
                3. Use .shipchecklist for custom checklists within maritime community
                4. Use PDF for official documentation and reports
                5. Test your import method with a small file first
                6. Keep backup copies in Files app
                7. Create an "Import" folder in Files for organization
                
                Troubleshooting Import Failures:
                • "Could not access file" = Save to Files app first
