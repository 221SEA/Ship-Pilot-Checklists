                ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Direct Import from Messaging Apps
                
                When receiving .json or .csv files through messaging apps (Signal, iMessage, WhatsApp, Teams, etc.), iOS security restrictions often prevent direct importing. Follow these steps for reliable imports:
                
                ‚úÖ Recommended Import Method:
                1. In your messaging app, tap and hold the file
                2. Choose "Save to Files"
                3. Select a location (iCloud Drive or On My iPhone)
                4. Open the Files app
                5. Find your saved file
                6. Tap the file to preview it
                7. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
                8. Select "Ship Pilot Checklists" from the share sheet
                
                Why This Extra Step?
                ‚Ä¢ Messaging apps store files in protected containers
                ‚Ä¢ iOS security prevents direct access between apps
                ‚Ä¢ The Files app provides a neutral, accessible location
                ‚Ä¢ This method works 100% of the time
                
                Alternative Methods That Also Work:
                ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Email attachments - Usually work directly
                ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ AirDrop - Works directly between iOS devices
                ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Cloud storage links - Download to Files first
                ‚Ä¢ ‚ùå Direct from messaging apps - Often fails
                
                Supported File Types:
                ‚Ä¢ .json - For contacts and checklists (universal format)
                ‚Ä¢ .csv - For contacts and checklists (spreadsheet format)
                ‚Ä¢ .shipchecklist - For custom checklists only
                
                Troubleshooting:
                If you see "Could not access the file" error:
                ‚Ä¢ You tried to import directly from a messaging app
                ‚Ä¢ Save to Files app first, then try again
                ‚Ä¢ Make sure the file isn't corrupted or empty
                
                üí° Pro Tip:
                Create a folder in Files app called "Ship Pilot Imports" to keep all your import files organized in one place.

                Exporting Contacts (JSON):
                1. Go to Contacts
                2. Tap "Export Contacts" at bottom
                3. Select categories to include:

                ‚Ä¢ Include a "Category" column to auto-organize contacts during import
                ‚Ä¢ Contacts with matching category names go into existing categories

                Column Header Recognition:
                The app recognizes many variations of column names:
                ‚Ä¢ "Phone Number", "Mobile", "Cell", "Telephone" all work for phone
                ‚Ä¢ "Contact Name", "Full Name", "Person" all work for names

                ‚Ä¢ Partial matches also work (e.g., header containing "phone")
                
                Import Process:
                1. Create spreadsheet with contact information
                2. Include a "Category" column to organize contacts automatically
                3. Save as standard CSV (not UTF-8 CSV)
                4. If receiving via messaging app, save to Files app first
                5. Share CSV file to Ship Pilot Checklists from Files app
                6. Contacts imported into their specified categories
                7. New categories created as needed
