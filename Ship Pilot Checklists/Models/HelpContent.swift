                5. Standardize contact information across pilot group
                
                CSV Alternative with Categories:
                Consider using CSV import instead if you need:
                • Automatic category organization during import
                • Bulk addition of maritime-specific fields
                • Import from existing spreadsheets or databases
                • Team-wide standardized contact lists
                
                The CSV import method allows you to specify categories for each contact, eliminating the manual drag-and-drop organization step.
                
                This is the fastest way to get your contact database established when first setting up the app.
